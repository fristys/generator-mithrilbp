> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-mithrilbp from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-mithrilbp
```

### Using the MithrilJS boilerplate generator

To create your project navigate to your desired dir and write

```bash
yo mithrilbp
```

To create a new module navigate to the root directory of your project and write

```bash
yo mithrilbp:module <name>
```

To create a new model navigate to the root directory of your project and write

```bash
yo mithrilbp:module <name>
```

To create a new component navigate to the root directory of your project and write

```bash
yo mithrilbp:component <name>
```
